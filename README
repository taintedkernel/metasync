************

Metasync is a file-metadata synchronization tool.  It allows you to automate
propagation of filename and/or directory changes to different remote locations.
It's particularly helpful in an rsync (or-similar)-based workflow in
combination with relatively large amounts of data.

The first use-case was to propagate updates via Lightroom from my photo
collection to several rsync-based backups.  Any sort of semi-frequent file
path updates will benefit from avoiding extra data transfer when syncing
to an external location.

In terms of implementation, metasync keeps an internal database of files
and attemps to determine changes over time through periodic invocation.  If
too many changes happen simultaneously (file contents updated, rename and move)
it may be difficult for the application to directly detect the correct
solution, in which case it will skip, prompt, or abort - especially if lots
of other similar changes were occuring in the same "snapshot" (time since last
successful invocation).
